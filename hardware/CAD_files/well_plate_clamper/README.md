* "well_plate_clamper" is the top cover design, which goes on top of the multiwell plates in order to secure them in place (necessary while using Diya in shaking incubators).

* "side_clamps" is the design which attaches on the back of the LED panel and helps in locking the well_plate_clamper at right height on the multiwell plates. You need to print 2 of them for one set.
